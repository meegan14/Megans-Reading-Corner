                        <li><strong>Title:</strong> Holiday Romance</li>
                        <li><strong>Author:</strong> Catherine Walsh</li>
                        <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Contemporary Christmas Romance</li>
                        <li><strong>Series:</strong> Fitzpatrick Christmas #1 - <em>Standalone</em> </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong><u>Background:</u></strong> In this book you follow Molly and Andrew over the span of present time and the past 10 years. Every year they both fly back to their home in Ireland from Chicago to spend Christmas with their families. However this year a huge storm has canceled their flight leaving them in a precarious situation. Molly doesn't care for Christmas quite like Andrew does but she vows to get him home! This book is just a banter full adventure between the two where their friendship may even cross into a potential relationship.</p>
                    <p><strong><u>Expectations:</u></strong> I've never read a book by this author before but I'm very excited to see where this goes, so far the banter and connection between the two characters is really good, I can feel that they have history and the potential for chemistry. I just wanted something fun to read before Christmas. Hey, nothing like a little christmas romance to get you in the holiday spirit.
