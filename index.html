                romance novels, and much more! It's a place of escapism and solace for all book enjoyers!

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Title:</strong> Wild Love</li>
                        <li><strong>Author:</strong> Elsie Silver</li>
                        <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Contemporary Romance</li>
                        <li><strong>Series:</strong> The Rose Hill Series</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong><u>Background:</u></strong> Wild Love is the highly anticipated first book in Elsie Silver's brand-new Rose Hill series. This book follows Ford who is Willas brother from her series Chestnut Springs, and a new character Rosie. Ford is working on building Rose Hill Records while juggling becoming a father suddenly, while Rosie leaves the city and her boyfriend behind after being fired from her job. In a need for money Rosie asks Ford who's her older brother's best friend to hire her so she can help him out with his daughter and Rose Hill records leading to a rekindling friendship and romance between the two.</p>
                    <p><strong><u>Expectations:</u></strong> I loved Elsie Silvers Chestnut Springs series, they were my favorite pallet cleanser books. I expect this book to be a no brain power fun time and so far Iâ€™m really enjoying it as well as seeing the acts of service Ford shows for Rosie!
