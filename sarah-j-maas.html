					Throne of Glass is nothing short of epic, not just in its plot but in its emotional depth, the intricate web of relationships Maas builds,
					and the masterful foreshadowing that plays out across the series. From the very first book, the story of Celaena Sardothien is about far
					more than just an assassin trying to survive—it's about discovering a deeper purpose, confronting the weight of her past, and learning to
					wield the incredible power within her. The journey that Maas takes you on is one of self-discovery, heart-wrenching sacrifice, and triumph,
					with plenty of shocking twists and emotional moments that keep you coming back for more.
				</p>
				<p>
					The world of Throne of Glass is expansive, filled with ancient secrets, political intrigue, and a slowly unraveling mystery that ties
					everything together. From the outset, Celaena is thrown into a deadly competition to become the King’s Champion—fighting against other
					assassins in a high-stakes battle that showcases her incredible skill, strength, and cunning. But Throne of Glass is more than just a deadly
					contest. The plot weaves through forbidden magic, dark secrets, and an oppressive kingdom, all of which hint at the greater story waiting to
					unfold.

						<p>
							As you read, you start to realize that everything is connected, from the strange occurrences surrounding Celaena’s victories to the
							subtle hints dropped throughout the book. The plot isn’t just a series of action-packed moments (though there are plenty of those); it’s
							a carefully crafted tapestry of foreshadowing, with clues about Celaena’s true identity, the forces at play, and the hidden power within
							her. Maas is a master of weaving these threads together over the course of the books, leading you to epic reveals that feel both earned
							and exhilarating. Every moment of foreshadowing feels intentional, and when the pieces finally click together, it’s like stepping into
							the light after being surrounded by shadows.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the things I admire most about Throne of Glass is Maas’s ability to keep you on the edge of your seat. The foreshadowing is so
							well-executed that it doesn’t hit you all at once—it’s subtle, lingering, and when the revelations happen, you’re left reeling.
							Celaena’s identity, the truth about her past, the political dynamics at play, and the dark forces working behind the scenes are all part
							of a long game that’s played out over the course of the series.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="row align-items-center mb-4">
					<div class="col-md-8 order-md-1">
						<p>
							Each book adds layers of complexity to the plot. What begins as a seemingly straightforward competition quickly becomes something much
							darker and deeper, with threats lurking at every corner. As Celaena faces off against dangerous enemies, she also uncovers pieces of her
							past that tie into the larger conflict. It’s an intricate dance of power, loyalty, and betrayal, and Maas never gives you all the
							answers upfront. Every book is like peeling back layers of an onion, revealing something new and sometimes unexpected. The foreshadowing
							and plot twists make each book a thrilling ride, and the way they all come together is nothing short of satisfying.
						</p>
						<p>
							The relationships in Throne of Glass are some of the most compelling parts of the series. What makes them stand out is how they evolve
							over time, growing deeper as characters face trials and tribulations that test their loyalty, trust, and resilience. Celaena’s
							relationships with the people around her—whether it’s with Chaol, Dorian, or the other characters she meets along the way—are complex
							and filled with nuance.
						</p>
						<p>
							Celaena’s connection with Chaol, the Captain of the Guard, is one of the most dynamic and deeply explored relationships in the series.
							It starts off with tension—Chaol is fiercely loyal to the King, while Celaena’s allegiances are far more complicated. But as they spend
							more time together, they begin to see each other’s strengths, vulnerabilities, and burdens. The emotional development of their
							relationship is gradual, and it feels so real because it’s built on mutual respect and understanding, even as they have their
							differences. Their relationship is a slow burn, one that feels both earned and heartbreaking, and it’s impossible not to root for them.

						<p>
							Then there’s Celaena’s relationship with Dorian, the Crown Prince. What starts as a playful and flirtatious bond grows into something
							much deeper, as Dorian’s own struggles with his role as heir to the throne become more apparent. There’s a beautiful contrast between
							Dorian’s optimism and Celaena’s hardened, cynical view of the world. The dynamic between them adds both tension and warmth to the story,
							with each character challenging the other in ways that lead to growth. Their relationship is both tender and intense, and it’s clear
							that they both become better versions of themselves through their connection.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, the relationships aren’t just about romance. Celaena also forms strong friendships with characters like Nehemia, the princess
							from Eyllwe, and the other women she meets throughout the series. These friendships are incredibly important to the development of her
							character, helping her see that she’s not alone and that the bonds of loyalty and love are worth fighting for. Maas does an incredible
							job of showing how these relationships evolve, particularly as Celaena learns to trust others and open up to the possibility of
							vulnerability.

							What makes Throne of Glass truly epic is how it blends these elements together: the high-stakes adventure, the emotional depth of the
							relationships, and the well-crafted foreshadowing that builds towards a larger, greater story. Celaena’s journey isn’t just about
							surviving—it’s about understanding who she is, accepting the scars of her past, and fighting for something worth protecting. The stakes
							are constantly raised, and just when you think you know where the story is headed, Maas throws in another twist that turns everything
							upside down. The way everything is interconnected—every choice, every relationship, every secret—creates a sense of grandiosity that
							makes Throne of Glass a true epic fantasy.

					When I first picked up A Court of Thorns and Roses, I had no idea I was about to be swept into one of the most immersive, emotionally
					gripping worlds I’d ever encountered. Maas’s storytelling in ACOTAR is rich, dark, and epic, with a careful balance of beauty and danger.
					The world-building is intricate, the characters are complex, and the plot is full of twists that keep you on your toes. What starts as a
					“Beauty and the Beast” inspired tale evolves into something far deeper, exploring themes of sacrifice, power, love, and survival.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Fae world Maas creates is vast, magical, and full of both wonder and terror. The story begins in the mortal realm, where Feyre, the
					protagonist, is hunting to feed her family. When she kills a wolf, unknowingly killing a faerie in disguise, she is taken by a beast-like
					faerie to the land of the Fae as punishment. What seems like an immediate punishment turns into an intricate exploration of the politics,
					beauty, and danger within the courts of the Fae
				</p>
				<!-- left -->
				<div class="row align-items-center mb-4">
					<div class="col-md-8 order-md-1">
						<p>
							Each court within the Fae realm is unique, with its own magic, beauty, and dangers. The Spring Court, where Feyre begins her journey, is
							lush, vibrant, and full of deceptive beauty. But as Feyre soon discovers, there’s much more to the Fae world than meets the eye, with
							deadly forces at play and secrets buried beneath the surface. The Night Court, which becomes central to the plot, is darker, with a more
							mysterious and dangerous energy. The contrast between the courts—each one carrying its own sense of power and mystery—creates an
							atmosphere full of tension, intrigue, and magic.
						</p>
						<p>
							The world-building in ACOTAR is incredible. Maas takes the time to describe not only the visual beauty of these realms but also their
							politics and history, from the history of the war between humans and Fae to the shifting alliances and rivalries that define each court.
							The Fae are not just magical beings; they have their own codes, secrets, and rules that impact everything Feyre does. The depth Maas
							brings to the world makes it feel incredibly immersive, and each court’s aesthetic and atmosphere create a rich backdrop for the drama
							and intrigue that unfold.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the most compelling aspects of ACOTAR is how Maas intricately weaves foreshadowing throughout the story. From the very first
							book, there are subtle hints about the true nature of the Fae world and Feyre’s connection to it. At first, Feyre is unsure of what’s
							going on, but as the plot progresses, you begin to understand that everything is connected, and no one is who they appear to be.

						<p>
							The foreshadowing in ACOTAR is brilliant because it’s not just about major plot twists—it’s about the way Maas builds a sense of mystery
							and tension. From the seemingly simple quest Feyre is given, to her interactions with Tamlin and the other Fae, every detail is part of
							the larger picture. The central mysteries—what happened to the High Fae, the curse that holds the Fae realm in its grip, and the mystery
							of the Summer Court—are slowly unraveled, with each book adding layers of complexity. What seems like a straightforward plot at
							first—Feyre’s struggle to survive in the Fae world—quickly becomes a battle of fate, loyalty, and power.
						</p>
						<p>
							The pacing of ACOTAR is masterful in this way, with each twist and reveal coming at just the right moment to keep you hooked. And when
							those plot twists hit, they pack a punch. The big reveals— the curse, the true nature of the High Fae—are earned, building on the subtle
							clues Maas laid down earlier. It’s the kind of storytelling that makes you want to reread the series to catch all the little details you
							missed the first time.
						</p>
						<p>
							One of the most fascinating parts of ACOTAR is the relationships Maas builds between the characters, particularly Feyre’s relationships
							with Tamlin, Rhysand, and other key figures. What makes these relationships so compelling is how they evolve over time, shaped by trust,
							sacrifice, and the weight of the characters’ personal journeys.

							Feyre’s relationship with Tamlin is central to the first book. On the surface, their relationship seems like a typical romance—Tamlin,
							the enigmatic Fae lord, and Feyre, the mortal woman he takes as his own. But as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that their
							relationship is much more complicated. Tamlin, while seemingly protective and caring, is also hiding dark secrets. His
							overprotectiveness and his unwillingness to confront the full truth of the world around him create tension in their relationship, and it
							soon becomes clear that Feyre’s journey is about more than just loving him—it’s about breaking free from the chains of this relationship
							and learning to see herself as more than just someone’s possession.
						</p>
						<p>
							Then there’s Rhysand, the High Lord of the Night Court, who enters Feyre’s life in a way that shifts everything. At first, he seems like
							the villain—charming, dangerous, and seemingly manipulative. But as the series progresses, Rhysand becomes one of the most complex and
							deeply empathetic characters in the series. His relationship with Feyre is built on respect, trust, and a shared understanding of pain
							and sacrifice. Rhysand pushes Feyre to be her best self, challenging her in ways Tamlin never did. What starts as a wary alliance
							transforms into a deep, emotional connection that shapes the course of the entire series. Their dynamic is one of the strongest elements
							of ACOTAR, and it’s a relationship that evolves beautifully over time.

							Beyond the main romantic relationships, Maas also weaves in strong friendships, particularly with characters like Mor, Amren, Cassian,
							and Azriel. These friendships add another layer to the story, showing how Feyre learns to rely on others and form bonds that aren’t just
							romantic. The sense of family and loyalty in the Night Court is one of the most touching aspects of the series, showing that love and
							trust go beyond just romantic feelings. At its heart, ACOTAR is about growth—personal, emotional, and even political. Feyre’s journey is
							not just about surviving in the Fae world; it’s about discovering her own strength, learning to trust herself, and understanding the
							power she holds within. The series tackles deep themes of sacrifice, self-worth, and the consequences of power. Feyre has to make
							choices that test her morality, and the weight of those decisions shapes her into the person she becomes by the end of the series.

						<p>
							Power is another recurring theme. The Fae realms are full of political intrigue, and the shifting balance of power is a constant
							undercurrent throughout the series. Feyre learns that power isn’t just about magic—it’s about knowing when to wield it and when to give
							it up for the greater good. The struggle for power and control is personal as much as it is political, with each character dealing with
							their own inner battles.
						</p>
						<p>
							What makes ACOTAR truly epic is how Maas weaves together the world-building, the emotional depth of the characters, and the complex,
							multi-layered plot. The series is full of high-stakes moments, both in terms of the battles for power and the internal battles the
							characters face. The world of the Fae feels real, vivid, and full of surprises, and the relationships are some of the most intense and
							rewarding I’ve ever read about. Maas never lets the stakes get too low—every moment feels important, every character feels meaningful,
							and every twist adds depth to the larger story. It’s a series that continues to evolve, surprise, and captivate in ways that make it an
							unforgettable reading experience.

				<p>
					Crescent City is one of Sarah J. Maas's most ambitious and intricate worlds. The first book in the series, House of Earth and Blood, opens
					up an urban fantasy landscape that feels both familiar and entirely new. Set in a city where humans coexist with powerful supernatural
					beings—Fae, angels, and shifters, to name a few—the series blends modern, bustling city life with high-stakes supernatural intrigue and a
					sense of ancient power. The complexity of the world-building, the character development, and the mysteries that unfold make Crescent City
					one of Maas’s most compelling works to date.
				</p>
				<!-- right -->
				<div class="row align-items-center mb-4">
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>
							The world of Crescent City is a stark departure from the more traditional fantasy settings of Maas’s earlier series. Instead of kingdoms
							and castles, we are introduced to a vibrant, modern city where magic exists alongside skyscrapers, neon lights, and high-tech devices.
							Crescent City itself is alive with tension—a city ruled by corporations that control supernatural creatures, organized crime syndicates,
							and political intrigue that operates behind the scenes.
						</p>
						<p>
							The world-building in Crescent City is vast and immersive. The city is divided into several districts, each governed by different
							factions or supernatural creatures. The humans, who were once at the top of the social hierarchy, now share power with beings of greater
							magical power. It’s a world that feels gritty and alive, where the dangers of the supernatural world are just as present as the problems
							of the human world—if not more so.
						</p>
						<p>
							But beyond the city’s modern, urban environment, there’s an underlying ancient, mystical history that governs the interactions between
							these beings. The Fae, the Angels, the Shifters—they all have their own customs, politics, and, most importantly, their own grudges. The
							complex social dynamics between these groups serve as the backdrop for the mysteries that drive the plot, and Maas reveals layers of
							history and intrigue that keep readers on the edge of their seats.
						</p>

							This blend of urban and supernatural fantasy is part of what makes Crescent City so compelling. It’s a world where magic is both an
							everyday part of life and a constant source of conflict. The high-tech aspects of Crescent City—computers, phones, and technology—sit
							side by side with ancient magical beings and rituals, creating an interesting contrast that grounds the fantastical in a familiar
							setting.
						</p>
						<p>
							At the heart of Crescent City is the murder mystery that drives the plot forward. The story begins with the brutal murder of a beloved
							figure in Crescent City—a murder that shakes the foundation of the supernatural world. Bryce Quinlan, the protagonist, is caught in the
							aftermath of this tragedy. Her life, already shattered by the loss of her closest friends, is further upended when she’s reluctantly
							drawn into the investigation to find the killer. As Bryce delves deeper into the mystery, she uncovers secrets that go far beyond what
							anyone could have imagined, leading her to question everything she thought she knew about her world and herself.

							The murder mystery is the catalyst for the entire story, but it’s also the gateway to much larger, more complex conflicts involving
							power, revenge, and ancient prophecies. The investigation pulls Bryce into a web of conspiracy and danger that involves gods, magical
							creatures, and the leaders of Crescent City itself. Each layer of the mystery reveals more about the city’s hidden power dynamics, and
							the further Bryce digs, the more she learns about her own role in these ancient conflicts. It’s a plot that keeps you guessing, filled
							with unexpected twists and revelations that constantly raise the stakes.
						</p>
						<p>
							What makes the plot even more thrilling is Maas’s pacing. There’s a perfect balance of action, emotional moments, and mystery-solving.
							The tension between solving the murder and Bryce’s personal journey is expertly woven throughout, keeping readers invested in both the
							action and the characters. And just when you think you have everything figured out, Maas delivers a shocking twist that will make you
							question everything again.
						</p>
						<p>
							Bryce Quinlan is, without a doubt, one of Maas’s most compelling heroines. She’s tough, resilient, and unapologetically herself. At the
							start of Crescent City, she is struggling with the aftermath of personal loss—the brutal murder of her best friend and the betrayal of
							someone she loved. Her pain is palpable, and her determination to push through it makes her a relatable character, despite her
							supernatural status. Bryce’s journey throughout the book is one of healing, justice, and self-discovery.
						</p>
						<p>
							Bryce is also not afraid to show vulnerability. She has her flaws and insecurities, and these moments of weakness make her even more
							human. She has a strong moral compass, but she’s not perfect. Throughout the story, we see her struggle with her identity, the
							responsibilities that come with her power, and her quest for vengeance. This internal conflict makes her an incredibly layered character
							who grows throughout the series.
						</p>
						<p>
							Her development is mirrored by her relationship with Hunt Athalar, the Fallen Angel who is assigned to protect her. Their dynamic is
							complicated—there’s instant chemistry, but it’s also fraught with tension, as both characters come from different worlds. Hunt, a
							warrior burdened with guilt and a history of suffering, has his own emotional baggage, and Maas expertly weaves their personal struggles
							into the development of their relationship. The slow burn of their bond is beautifully done, with each interaction peeling back more
							layers of their personalities and histories.

						<p>
							Bryce’s relationships—whether with Hunt, her friends, or her enemies—are some of the most intriguing aspects of the book. Maas carefully
							develops each connection, making them feel real and impactful. Bryce is a character who doesn’t just sit back and let things happen to
							her—she’s an active participant in her story, and her relationships reflect her complexity as an individual.
						</p>
						<p>
							House of Earth and Blood is more than just a murder mystery—it’s a deep exploration of loss, power, and redemption. The series tackles
							big themes, such as the impact of trauma, the consequences of power, and the value of friendship and loyalty. Bryce’s personal journey
							is one of overcoming grief, learning to trust herself again, and accepting that she has the strength to face the dark forces at play in
							Crescent City. Her arc is about not just surviving but reclaiming the power that was taken from her, and learning how to use that power
							for good.

							The exploration of power in the Fae world is complex. Those in positions of power—whether gods, angels, or corporate moguls—hold immense
							influence, but that power often comes with great cost. Maas doesn’t shy away from showing the darker sides of power and the lengths to
							which people will go to maintain it. The social structures Maas creates in Crescent City reveal just how fragile this balance of power
							can be, and how easily it can tip into corruption.
						</p>
						<p>
							At its core, Crescent City is about redemption—whether it’s Bryce seeking justice for her loved ones, Hunt working through his guilt, or
							the various secondary characters who find themselves at a crossroads. Maas expertly threads these themes throughout the story, making
							the stakes feel personal and high.
						</p>
						<p>
							Crescent City is epic not only for its scope but for how deeply Maas invests in her characters, her plot, and her world-building. The
							city itself feels alive, the characters feel real and complex, and the plot is filled with so many twists and turns that you’re never
							quite sure what’s going to happen next. There’s a perfect blend of mystery, action, romance, and personal growth. Maas's skill in
							weaving these elements together makes Crescent City a standout in the world of urban fantasy. It’s a series that, while set in a modern
							world, feels timeless and grand in scope.

			<!-- Reading Order -->
			<div class="p-4 mb-5" style="background-color: #53483c; border-radius: 15px">
				<h2 class="text-center mb-3">Reading Order</h2>
				<p>
					Within this universe (the Maasverse) there are a total of 16 books to read which can be very overwhelming. That being so, I’m going to give
					my recommendations as to where to get started. I recommend starting with A Court of Thorns and Roses first. Read this whole series, it's a
					total of five books, one of them being a short novella. ACOTAR is a good start for adjusting to Maas’s writing style and it's not so heavy
					on world politics until later in the series. ACOTAR focuses a lot more on Feyre’s experience as well as romantic relationships making it a
					good start.
				</p>
				<p>
					After finishing ACOTAR completely I would then move into Throne of Glass which has the most difficult reading order. Throne of Glass and
					Crown of Midnight were released before The Assassin's Blade however The Assassin's Blade was released as a prequel to Throne of Glass so it
					confuses people when to read it. Some people read it first, some third, some fourth. Personally I read it fourth, I found it to be a good
					transition book before moving on to Heir of Fire. However if you think maybe you’ll need the background to better understand Celaena's
					character and why she's where she is in Throne of Glass then read The Assassin's Blade. But if you’re like me and would rather be thrown
					right into the story then jump right into Throne of Glass no order is wrong, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you read the fifth book, Queen of Shadows the next two are Empire of Storms and Tower of Dawn. This is where it gets complicated. Some
					people will read the books on their own, some will just skip Tower of Dawn completely. I don’t agree with skipping it at all, I think it's
					imperative in order to read Kingdom of Ash. This being so I highly recommend doing the Tandem read which is where you read both books at the
					same time switching between the two every couple of chapters. This is because each book is following different characters in different parts
					of the world at the same time. The best way to put it is all the action is happening in Empire of Storms but all the information is in Tower
					of Dawn. I used this guide someone had taken the time to put together in order to know when to switch between the two books. I promise it is
					so worth it!!
				</p>
				<p>
					Lastly, you can finally read Crescent City which involves a lot of heavy world building, it’s very common for most people not to understand
					what's happening in the first 100 pages of House of Earth and Blood. That’s okay I say push through. Each book in this series is very long–
					ike 800 pages each–so they can become very heavy but I promise the full circle moments throughout make it incredible. It’s the perfect way
					to end reading the Maaverse in preparation for any future books Sarah J. Maas plans to publish.
